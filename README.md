# Style Guide

Code standards and reusable snippets.

I find myself Googling simple things like "html meta tags" far too often. This is a simple reference for those situations. I'm hoping to make updates as new standards emerge. All style guides are hosted on GitHub and can be edited by anyone. Please submit a pull request with any suggestions for improvement.

This guide is also available on [my personal site](http://coryetzkorn.com/library).
